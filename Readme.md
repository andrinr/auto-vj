Auto-vj was a high school graduation project. The goal was to provide a software which is able to replace visual jockeys. 
The software does not require any cues from the band or the dj, it tries to detect changes in the rhythm of the song strucutre automaticially.
Besides the software integrates the kinect for interactions with the observers.
